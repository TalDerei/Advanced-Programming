# Standard Makefile for a C++ project that compiles each .cc file into a .o
# file, and then links .o files together to produce an executable.
#
# NB: we are using the "makefile includes d-files" technique to carefully
# track dependencies.  

#
# The only part of this file that will change from one project to the next is 
# right here, where we provide the names of the .cc files
#

# names of .cc files that have a main() function
TARGETS = Main

# names of other .cc files
CXXFILES = # no common files :)

#
# The rest of this file should never need to change
#

# Let the programmer choose 32 or 64 bits, but default to 64 bit
BITS ?= 64

# Specify the name of the folder where all output will go
ODIR := ./obj$(BITS)

# This line ensures that the above folder will be created before any compiling
# happens.
output_folder := $(shell mkdir -p $(ODIR))

# Generate the names of the .o files and .exe files that we will be creating.
# Note that we name all .o files explicitly, so that we can add them to the
# .PRECIOUS target, which prevents them from being auto-removed.
